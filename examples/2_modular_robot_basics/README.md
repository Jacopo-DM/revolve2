# [2] Modular Robot Basics

Revolve2 is a framework, which is designed towards modular robot evolution, meaning robots are a collection of arbitrary modules.
The Morphology (Body) of these robots can be evolved as well as their Controller (Brain).

In this collection of examples you will learn the following:

- `2a_custom_brain` you will walk through the process of making a custom brain to use for your robots.
- `2b_brain_with_feedback` you will learn how a brain can use sensors on the robots for some advanced control.
